# Docker Compose

- Referência: `https://blog.4linux.com.br/docker-compose-explicado/`

Para realizar a execução de um contêiner basta executar o comando docker container run, porém, e se for necessário executar vários contêineres de uma única vez e cada um com um propósito distinto?  

Seria muito trabalhoso executar diversas vezes o mesmo comando e ainda incluir os parâmetros necessários, além da criação da rede e volumes, se necessário.

É aí que entra o Docker Compose, para facilitar o gerenciamento de multi-contêineres principalmente em ambientes de desenvolvimento.
